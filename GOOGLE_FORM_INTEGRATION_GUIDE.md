# Google Form Integration Guide

## Overview
Your exhibitor registration form is now connected to your Google Form. When users fill out the form on your website, it will automatically pre-fill the Google Form with their information.

## How It Works
1. User fills out the exhibitor registration form on your website
2. When they click "REGISTER AS EXHIBITOR", the form validates their input
3. A confirmation dialog appears asking if they want to proceed
4. If confirmed, a new tab opens with your Google Form pre-filled with their data
5. User can review the information and submit the Google Form
